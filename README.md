# PhotonASCII

<h1>A terminal-based, raycast-light engine in C++ (2D)</h1>

<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>First, you will need to get the <code>photon-ascii</code> folder and it's contents.</p>
<p>Then, simply create a main.cpp file at the level of the folder, and place this line at the top of your<code>main.cpp</code> file: <code>#include "photon-ascii/self.hpp"</code></p>
<p>That's it. You can add and edit stuff in the folder to your likings, and for a working example, have a look at the <code>main.cpp</code> file in this repo.</p>
<p>Also; have a look at the <code>self.hpp</code> file in the <code>photon-ascii</code> folder. There are some things to configure if you want/ need to.</p>
<p>Examples are located at <code>examples/</code> Idk why I said that, makes sense haha, but here you go.</p>

<h1>What can you do with it?</h1>

<p>PhotonASCII provides a way to interact with light and self made structures (Yes, you can move and animate structures in the tick loop)</p>
<p>With this, you can create games, rendering, paintings, interactive UI, fancy terminal stuff, and much more</p>

<h4>Have fun casting chars as photons!</h4>
